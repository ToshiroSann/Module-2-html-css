        <h1>Why Tunnels?</h1>
        <p><strong>Solve traffic:</strong> to solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D. Surface
            roads today incorporate 3D model-like elevated highways and cloverleaf<br> interchanges that are expensive
            and disruptive to build. Tunneling networks are 3D and provide high-throughput transportation in an
            economically viable way.</p>

        <p><strong>Beautify our cities:</strong> existing transportation networks occupy valuable space in cities where
            land availability is scarce. Tunnels minimize usage of surface area and <br>could move entire transportation
            networks underground. Taking transportation underground allows us to repurpose roads into
            community-enhancing spaces, and<br> beautify our cities.</p>

        <p><strong>Enable Hyperloop:</strong> Hyperloop networks unlock high-speed regional transportation surpassing
            other alternatives. Hyperloop enables access to individualized, point to point<br> high-speed
            transportation.</p>

        <h1>Construction</h1>
        <p><strong>Utilities:</strong> with a typical minimum depth of 30 feet, our tunnels are well beneath most
            utilities, which are typically less than 10 feet below the surface. <br>In circumstances where a utility is
            located deeper, the tunnel depth is increased accordingly</p>

        <p><strong>No disruptive surface vibration or noise during tunneling:</strong> once a tunnel boring machine is
            below approximately two tunnel diameters, or 28 feet, the tunneling<br> process is almost impossible to
            detect, especially in soft soil. The tunnel operation is inaudible, and there is typically more surface
            vibration felt from a pedestrian <br>walking nearby than from the TBM operating 30+ feet below</p>

        <p><strong>Managing excavated dirt:</strong> in typical tunneling projects, excavated dirt is shipped offsite to
            disposal locations. This process is costly, time-consuming, noisy, and <br>environmentally-unsustainable. We
            recycle a portion of the muck into useful bricks and pavers to be used to build anything from affordable
            housing to patios. This is <br>not a new concept, as buildings have been constructed from earth for
            thousands of years including, according to recent evidence, the Pyramids. These earth blocks <br>can
            potentially be used as a portion of the tunnel lining itself, which is typically built from concrete. Since
            concrete production accounts for 4.5% of the worldâ€™s <br>greenhouse gas emissions, earth blocks would reduce
            both environmental impact and tunneling costs</p>
